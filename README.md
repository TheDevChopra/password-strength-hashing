# Password Strength & Hashing Visualizer

**A simple CLI demo that evaluates password strength and shows hashing (SHA256 + salted demo).**

![demo](examples/demo.gif)

## What is this?
A beginner-friendly tool I built to learn about password best practices and hashing. It evaluates password strength (length, uppercase, lowercase, digits, special chars) and shows SHA256 + salted hash outputs.

## How to run
**Online interpreter (no install needed):**
1. Copy `password_strength_hashing_online.py` into an online Python runner (Replit / Programiz).
2. Run and input a test password.

**Locally:**
```bash
python password_strength_hashing_online.py
